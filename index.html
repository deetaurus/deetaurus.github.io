            <h4>About me</h4>
            <p>I am a Master of Engineering student in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University. I am actively looking for summer intern opportunities. My interests are in machine learning and web development </p>
            <h4>Experience</h4>
            <ul>
            <li> Software Engineer II, Cisco Systems (June 2012 - December 2015) </li>
             Developing Layer3 features on Cisco's next-generation core routing systems, namely, Carrier Routing System (CRS) and Network Convergence System 6000 (NCS6k) that provide 40-400Gbps and 1-2Tbps per slot respectively. 

            <ul>
                <li> TCAM Manager - Resource Manager (RM) for the TCAM (Ternary Content Addressable Memory) hardware which stores forwarding information for packet processing. I was actively involed in prototype and development phase of TCAM RM for Cisco's next-Gen NCS6k and CRS routers. </li>
                <li> Quality of Service(QoS) - CRS and NCS6k are designed to provide wire-rate unicast IMIX forwarding for IPv4, MPLS and IPv6 streams with multiple high-touch services running concurrently. I was actively involved in the implementation of End-to-End QoS on CRS and NCS6k. </li>
                <li> Network Processing Unit (NPU) - Resource Manager that configures, initializes and manages resources which hold information on how to process the network traffic and handling faults of varying nature on the device. I was involved in the implementation of NPU RM for Cisco's CRS. </li>
                <li> IPv6 Compression Algorithm - Due to the TCAM's hardware limitation on CRS, IPv6 addresses need to be compressed and stored. I had made significant contributions that enhanced the robustness of the heuristic algorithm. </li>
                <li> Netflow - Netflow Accounting is a L3 feature on Cisco CRS series. I had prototyped and tested Sample and Destination Based Netflow on various IOS-XR releases for CRS. </li>
            </ul> </li>
            <li>
            Software Intern, Cisco Systems (Jan 2012 - June 2012) </li> 
            Study and analysis of Cisco propriety "IPv6 Compression" Algorithm. It's a Huffman based algorithm that helps in the IPv6 forwarding on Core Routers.  Developed a python script that resolves collision scenarios during progressive iterations. 
        </ul>

            <h4> Academic Projects </h4> 
            <ul> 
            <li> Topic Modeling for Recommendation Enginers </li>
            Evaluate a variety of topic modeling algorithms over a number less common datasets, focusing on highlighting how algorithm performance changes depending on the application and corpus
            <li>  Implementation of Cis-gene regulation in genetic assimilation  </li> 
            A computational model for the representation of the cis-regulatory element acting upon the genetic assimilation in various generations of a population. The model is developed in Java using Eclipse JDK IDE.  
            <b>Advisor: Prof. V.N. Muralidhara </b>

            <li> Age Checker  </li> A Utility that recursively scans hard disk and estimates the lifetime of files using Randomized Methods for Web Crawling. The tool scans the complete system and comes up with suggestions for cleanly if there is a space criticality constraint.
            <b>Advisor: Prof. Raghavan </b>

            <li> Reconfiguration to reduce power consumption </li>
            This project deals with developing the intelligence used to adapt the system to its current requirements and the associated actions that result in optimization of power minimization. Based on the data collected with regard to performance and power consumption, an application was developed using QT Creator in C++ to reconfigure the system resources in order to achieve maximum energy efficiency.             
            <b>Advisor: Prof. Shrisha Rao </b>

            <li>Designing a DSL for library management system using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 </li>
            This project designs a domain specific language and creates a domain instance for various use cases specified as part of the library management system. The implementation of the DSL was performed using Microsoft Visual Studio DSL Toolkit 2008. 
            <b>Advisor: Prof. R. Chandrashekar </b>

            <li>Column Data Store(CDS) </li>
            CDS is a column data store where data is stored not as a collection of records but as a collection of individual columns.CDS supports all the basic operations needed for managing persistent records. 
            <b>Advisor: Prof. R. Chandrashekar </b>

            <li>Capacity planning in Supply Chain Management (SCM) </li>
            Capacity planning determines the capacity of various facilities in the supply chain to optimally meet future conditions. Capacity planning under uncertainty is when conditions of the future are uncertain. We have developed an algorithm that solves for the total capacity required for a given certain demand. The algorithm is a modified version of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO).
